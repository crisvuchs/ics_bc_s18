#### pictures.rb
#- Requirements
#  - Adapt the picture-downloading/file-renaming program to your computer by adding
#    some safety features to make sure you never overwrite a file. A few methods
#    you might find useful are `File.exist?` (pass it a filename, and it will return
#    `true` or `false`) and `exit` (like if `return` and Napoleon had a babyâ€”it kills
#    your program right where it stands; this is good for spitting out an error
#    message and then quitting).
#- Clarifications/Advice
#  - We've provided you with skeleton code for it, you'll just need to adapt the
#    Directory stuff (more instructions for that are in the comments), and add the
#    file overwrite check.
#  - For the overwrite check, it should detect if a file would be overwritting an
#    existing one, and prompt the user to see if they want to continue.


### In this next line you want to give it the file path of where you want the
###  pictures moved. I recommend using an absolute filepath.
###
### An example for mac could be '/Users/username/Desktop/pic_dst'
### An example for PC could be 'C:/Users/username/Desktop/pic_dst'
Dir.chdir "/home/clvasiliu/Desktop/code/ics_bc_s18/Processed_Pictures"

# First we find all of the pictures to be moved.
### In the next line you want the source
### Note the '/*.jpg' at the end, this is going to grab anything in the
###  final folder that ends in '.jpg' and stash it in an array.
###
### An example for mac could be '/Users/username/Desktop/pic_src/**/*.{JPG,jpg}'
### An example for PC could be 'C:/Users/username/Desktop/pic_src/**/*.{JPG,jpg}'
