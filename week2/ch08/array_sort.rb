#### array\_sort.rb
#- Requirements
#  - Write the program we talked about at the
#    beginning of this chapter, one that asks us to type as many words as we
#    want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an
#    empty line) and then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order.
#- Clarifications/Advice
#  - Make sure to test your program thoroughly; for example, does hitting `Enter`
#    on an empty line always exit your program? Even on the first line? And the
#    second?
#  - Thereâ€™s a lovely array method that will give you a sorted version of an
#    array: `.sort`. Use it!
