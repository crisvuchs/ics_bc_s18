#### log.rb
#- Requirements
#  - Write a method called `log` that takes a string description of a block (and,
#    of course, a block). Similar to the method `do_self_importantly`, it should
#    puts a string telling you it started the block and another string at the end
#    telling you it finished and also telling you what the block returned. Test
#    your method by sending it a code block. Inside the block, put another call
#    to `log`, passing a block to it. In other words, your output should look
#    something like this:
#    ~~~
#    Beginning "outer block"...
#    Beginning "some little block"...
#    ..."some little block" finished, returning: 5
#    Beginning "yet another block"...
#    ..."yet another block" finished, returning: I like Thai food!
#    ..."outer block" finished, returning: false
#    ~~~
#- Clarifications/Advice
#  - Make sure to test it with a set of blocks at least three deep. That way
#    youâ€™ll be sure it works as expected.
def log desc, &block
  puts 'Beginning "' + desc + '"...'
  result = block.call
  puts '..."' + desc + '" finished, returning: ' + result.to_s
