#### orange_tree.rb
#- Requirements
#  - Implementations and details can vary quite a bit, but here are the required
#    methods:
#    - `initialize`
#      - Creates your tree, initializes your variables
#    - `one_year_passes`
#      - Your tree grows older:
#        - It grows in height
#        - Sprouts some number of oranges after a certain age
#        - Dies after some number of years
#    - `height`
#      - Tells you how tall your tree is
#    - `age`
#      - Tells you how old your tree is
#    - `orange_count`
#      - Tells you how many oranges are hanging from your tree
#    - `pick_orange`
#      - If thereâ€™s oranges to be picked, gives you one
#- Clarifications/Advice
#  - To make sure you get them all, we've given skeleton code with them there.
#    You just have to define them
